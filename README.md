# 🧠 Optimal Strategy for a Game using Dynamic Programming
This project was developed as a component of the Algorithm analysis course. A Java project employing dynamic programming to implement the Optimal game strategy of coins.            

## 🎮 Problem Description
This is a two-player game. There are even number of coins arranged in a row. There will be 
alternate turns. In each turn, a player can either select the first coin in the row or the last coin in
